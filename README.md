K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning Practical
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Practical

This is a practical for K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model machine learning classification model. 

The goal is to group predict the class or label which a new customer will belong to base on certain characteristics of the customer such as age and income. Customers in the dataset are already grouped into 4 categories denoted by `custcat` in the dataset. This is the target vairable for which we are trying to predict which category or class a new customer would belong to based on certain features. 

Before we dive into the practical, here is an overview of key steps in the practical:
* Loading the required libraries
* Data processing and exploration
* Data modelling
* Insight and model evaluation

**The data for this practical was obtained from the IBM cloud storage**.
